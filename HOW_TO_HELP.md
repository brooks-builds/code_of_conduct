# How to Give Help in the Brooks Builds Community

## What is this guide all about?

When a community member asks for help this guide can help us determine if we should offer help, and how to go about doing that.

## Why do we need a guide?

Two reasons, first sometimes the act of helping someone can turn from help to harm very quickly. I don’t mean harm in that they are damaged, but rather their learning opportunities are greatly reduced. This is most often the case when the help requested is for a learning project, like homework or following a course example.

In the case of someone needing help for work related questions, it can be helpful to have a guide to ensure that we are consistent in the quality of help that we provide.

## Why Help?

We give help to community members because it will help everyone grow and improve. The person receiving the help will get passed whatever is blocking them, and the person giving help will also improve their skills as well. 

It is recommended to attempt to give help especially if you are learning the subject. The act of explaining, questioning, and researching will improve your skills more than the person who is being helped.

## How to give help?

It depends on the context of the problem, we should first ascertain why the question is being asked, and also what kind of work is being done as well as any deadlines for this work. 

Generally we want to avoid giving away the answer directly for all requests other than work problems with deadlines

### Homework

For this we want to provide help through the form of asking leading questions. The goal is to have the student answer the question themselves and therefore gain the most knowledge possible. You can start by asking questions about the problem as normal until you have a good theory as to what is wrong.

Then switch to leading questions to see if the student can get to the solution on their own. 

If frustration sets in, or this method isn’t leading to a successful intervention then we can switch to a pairing method. Having the student drive, have them run experiments on their code until they happen upon the solution. Then ask the student to explain why it works. 

If you must give the answer and/or explanation to the student directly, ask them to repeat back to you in their own words. 

### Project - No deadline

If the problem is related to a project (personal or for a day job) and there isn’t a tight deadline associated with the work then we can follow the same guidelines as above with homework. We can be a bit looser on requiring the asker to prove understanding.

### Project - Deadline

If the problem is related to a project that is due soon (within 1 week) then we don’t always have time to follow the above methods of ensuring understanding while giving help. We can ask questions to determine what the problem is but then should give experiments to try to solve the problem. We can invite the asker to come back for understanding after they have met their deadline.

### Other

Other types of problems, including those that prevent the asker from working on homework, or one of the courses can be solved with direct suggestions. The point here is to unblock the learner so that they can get to the real problems as quickly as possible. It’s possible that they don’t want to learn whatever is blocking them, and that’s okay.

## Violations

If a learner who is working on homework is refusing to take part in the help methods above but is still asking questions and taking up helpers time, then we reserve the right to ban them from the community. First offenses will be a timeout, but subsequent may result in long-term removal from the community.
