# Brooks Builds Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to the greater community around Brooks Builds. This includes

* All GitHub projects within the [Brooks-Builds](https://github.com/brooks-builds) organization
* The [Brookzerker](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker) Twitch.tv channel
* The [Brooks Builds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1-XRVnJA-wws2bfbLbFcQ) YouTube channel

The short of the code of conduct is to be awesome to each other. We are all here to learn, improve, and help each other not only survive, but thrive while improving ourselves.

## Need to report a code of conduct violation?

You can contact Brooks directly and privately through the following methods to open a dialog about what happened / is happening and how we can solve it. 

* [Whisper](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2015/06/10/psst-hey-you-let-s-whisper-2a84ac496804/) message on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker)
* Direct message on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/brooks_patton)
* Direct message on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). (Brooks' username is _brookzerker#6643_)

No violation is too small to let me know about. I want to keep this community healthy and safe for all members and that means that we crack down on anti-inclusivity as soon as it happens.

## Timeout offenses

A timeout on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker) chat is a short timeout (around 5 minutes) where the messages that caused the timeout will be deleted as well as preventing the receiver of the timeout to not be able to send messages for the duration of the timout. The following actions can cause a chat timeout.

* Posting a message about a topic after being asked repeatedly to not post said topic
* Advertising in chat without permission
* Using harrassing speach towards any people (making fun of technology is ok, making fun of people will result in a timeout)
* Violating the Culture of Error and Growth Mindset agreements after being asked to stop

## Banable offenses

Sometimes a timeout isn't enough and a ban is required. A ban is where a specific account cannot contribute to conversations, or pull requests. We are banning by account as opposed to IP addresses as IP addresses can be spoofed, also accounts are required for participating in the community. The following actions can cause a ban.

* Violating the timeout offenses multiple times
* Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
* Threats of violence
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sexually explicit or violent material
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Stalking or following
* Any other kinds of harassment Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

## Culture of error

This is community focused around learning and constantly improving ourselves. It is near impossible to do this without allowing ourselves the freedom to fail publicly. Brooks models this failing during his streams and all members of the community are encouraged to join in.

Only through risking failure can we learn how not to fail.

## Growth mindset

A growth mindset is one where we understand that people can change through hard work and not giving up. In this community we encourage everyone to adopt a growth mindset where we can adapt to whatever challenges we are facing so that we can not only survive them, but thrive in the face of them.

Only through change can we adapt to handle what life is throwing at us.
